# Shaurya's Developer Portfolio

Hi there! I'm **Shaurya**, a backend engineer who thrives on building scalable systems, clean APIs, and automated pipelines. This portfolio is a curated showcase of my skills, projects, and experimentsâ€”designed and built with a minimal, modern tech stack to reflect my engineering philosophy: **clarity, performance, and impact**.
